## Introduction

The Dippy Roleplay subnet on Bittensor aims to create the world's best open-source roleplay LLM by leveraging the collective efforts of the open-source community. This subnet addresses the critical issue of loneliness, which affects a significant portion of the population and is linked to various mental and physical health problems. 

Current SOTA LLMs are designed for the assistant use case and lack the empathetic qualities necessary for companionship. While some companies (c.ai, chai, inflection etc) have developed closed-source roleplay LLMs, the open-source alternatives lag significantly behind in performance. 

Our team at Impel Intelligence Inc. knows this issue intimately through building Dippy, a proactive AI companion app for iOS.  In this subnet, we will bring together the entire open-source eco-system to build the worldâ€™s best roleplay LLM.
